# example-programs-emdros
Example programs for the Emdros text database engine

## What is this?

Some example programs making use of the Emdros text database engine.

Two examples are provided:

- A HAL implementation (Hyperspace Analogue to Language)
- Emdros Chunking Tool (A GUI tool to split texts into chunks)

## Why this repo?

So as to:

- Keep the Emdros repo small, and

- Provide examples of how to integrate Emdros, and

- Provide a means for (automatically) checking that an Emdros build
  works.

## Are these good examples?

The Chunking Tool is a moderately good example.

The HAL implementation is not such a good example of what you can do
with Emdros.

## Where is Emdros?

https://emdros.org/

## What is Emdros?

A text database engine.

Think of a Relational Database Management System, such as PostgreSQL,
MySQL, or SQLite.  But for text -- annotated text.

## What is annotated text

Text plus information about that text

## Support?

Yes.  Contact Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen via GitHub or via email:
